This release introduces Kevin Wright as maintainer of the package.  The former maintainer says:

Kevin,

Thank you for taking care of this package and I am pretty grateful if you would be in charge. But I haven't use R for long and don't know how to transfer the ownership. May take a few days for me to figure it out. 
It would be appreciated if you happened to know how to do it. Would let you know about its progress.

Sincerely,

Rutong Zeng
